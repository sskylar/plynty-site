Beyond plynty’s technological safeguards, the team’s own ability to access your information is limited. Authorized members of our technical team are able, in specific circumstances, to view data to ensure proper functioning of the app. We also view anonymized, aggregate data in order to understand how people are using the app and how we can offer more value to users.
