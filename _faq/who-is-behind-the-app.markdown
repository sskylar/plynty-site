*plynty* is a product of AEM Corporation, a global provider of diversified services to government agencies and commercial businesses.  The *plynty* app is a collaboration of AEM's Information Technology unit (Vizuri, LLC) and its financial advice unit (Compendium Finance, LLC).

We took on this venture to do our part to help address America’s retirement crisis and use our talents to deliver financially unbiased retirement, investment, and insurance advice to those who need it most. Our team has been cited by the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post for its research on how to make retirement planning simple and more effective.
